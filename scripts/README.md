# Scripts Documentation

## Overview

The `scripts/` directory contains modular Bash scripts for automating common development and testing workflows. Each script has a targeted function, making it easy to run only what you need and integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

**Important:** All scripts run within the Minikube environment. Remember to:
- Start Minikube before running scripts: `minikube start`
- Stop Minikube when done: `minikube stop`

---

## Script Reference

### Build & Deployment Scripts

#### `build_image.sh`
**Purpose:** Build the Docker image for the Flask application.

**What it does:**
- Sets up Minikube Docker environment
- Builds Docker image with tag `hello-flask:latest`
- Verifies image was created successfully

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/build_image.sh
```

**When to run:** After making changes to application code or Dockerfile

---

#### `deploy_local.sh`
**Purpose:** Deploy the application to local Kubernetes cluster with Ingress.

**What it does:**
- Sets up Ingress controller (if not already configured)
- Applies Kubernetes manifests (deployment, service, ingress, configmap, secret)
- Waits for pods to become ready
- Displays access information

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/deploy_local.sh
```

**When to run:** After building the image, to deploy to Minikube

**Note:** This deploys with Ingress (ClusterIP service). For NodePort deployment, apply manifests manually.

---

#### `delete_local.sh`
**Purpose:** Clean up all Kubernetes resources.

**What it does:**
- Deletes all application resources (deployment, service, ingress, configmap, secret)
- Confirms cleanup was successful

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/delete_local.sh
```

**When to run:** When you need to clean up resources or start fresh

---

### Testing Scripts

#### `unit_tests.sh`
**Purpose:** Run application-level unit tests.

**What it does:**
- Runs pytest on `app/tests/` directory
- Tests Flask application logic independently of Kubernetes

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/unit_tests.sh
```

**Duration:** Fast (~1-2 seconds)

---

#### `k8s_tests.sh`
**Purpose:** Run Kubernetes integration tests (automated suite only).

**What it does:**
- Runs pytest on `test_k8s/` directory
- Excludes manual tests using `-m 'not manual'` marker
- Tests deployment, services, ingress, probes, configmaps

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/k8s_tests.sh
```

**Duration:** ~15-20 seconds

**Note:** Excludes manual tests (pod deletion, crash recovery) for faster feedback

---

#### `liveness_test.sh`
**Purpose:** Run liveness probe and self-healing tests with multiple modes.

**What it does:**
- **Default mode:** Runs automated liveness probe configuration tests
- **Manual mode:** Runs behavioral tests (pod deletion, crash recovery)
- **Config mode:** Runs only configuration checks
- Tests `/health` endpoint and liveness probe behavior
- Verifies automatic container restart on failure

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automated configuration tests only (default)
bash scripts/liveness_test.sh

# Manual behavioral tests (pod deletion, crash recovery)
bash scripts/liveness_test.sh --manual

# Configuration check only
bash scripts/liveness_test.sh --config
```

**Duration:**
- Automated/Config: Fast (~2-3 seconds)
- Manual: Slow (~60-90 seconds)

**Note:** Manual tests involve wait times and are best run explicitly. Readiness probe tests are in `readiness_test.sh`.

---

#### `readiness_test.sh`
**Purpose:** Run readiness probe and traffic routing tests with multiple modes.

**What it does:**
- **Default mode:** Runs automated readiness probe configuration tests
- **Manual mode:** Runs behavioral tests (traffic routing, pod readiness)
- **Config mode:** Runs only configuration checks
- Tests `/ready` endpoint and readiness probe behavior
- Verifies ready replicas match desired count

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automated configuration tests only (default)
bash scripts/readiness_test.sh

# Manual behavioral tests (traffic routing validation)
bash scripts/readiness_test.sh --manual

# Configuration check only
bash scripts/readiness_test.sh --config
```

**Duration:**
- Automated/Config: Fast (~2-3 seconds)
- Manual: May involve timing (~10-30 seconds)

**Note:** Readiness probe determines when pods receive traffic. Separate from liveness probe which handles container restarts.

---

#### `health_endpoint_tests.sh`
**Purpose:** Run comprehensive /health endpoint tests in development.

**What it does:**
- Temporarily switches service from ClusterIP to NodePort
- Runs all health endpoint integration tests
- Automatically restores service to ClusterIP after testing
- Safe cleanup even if tests fail (uses trap)

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/health_endpoint_tests.sh
# or
make health-tests
```

**Duration:** ~30-40 seconds

**When to run:**
- Development testing of /health endpoint behavior
- Validating health check performance and reliability
- Testing health endpoint during replica scaling

**Note:** 
- Requires active deployment
- Temporarily modifies service configuration (auto-restored)
- Not included in smoke tests (runs separately for development)

---

#### `smoke_test.sh`
**Purpose:** Quick validation of all critical functionality (automated tests only).

**What it does:**
- Runs all automated Kubernetes tests
- Excludes manual tests using `-m 'not manual'` marker
- Provides fast feedback on deployment health

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

**Duration:** ~15-20 seconds

**When to run:** After deployment to quickly verify everything works

---

### Utility Scripts

#### `port_forward.sh`
**Purpose:** Forward service port to localhost for local testing.

**What it does:**
- Sets up port forwarding from localhost:8080 to service port 5000
- Keeps running until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
- Displays access URL

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/port_forward.sh
# Then access: http://localhost:8080
```

**When to run:** When you need to test the service directly without Ingress/NodePort

**Note:** Blocks terminal - use Ctrl+C to stop

---

#### `minikube_service_url.sh`
**Purpose:** Get service URL and access methods.

**What it does:**
- Auto-detects service type (NodePort or ClusterIP)
- Provides appropriate access instructions and tests connectivity
- For NodePort: Shows `minikube service` URL and tests the service
- For ClusterIP+Ingress: Shows multiple access methods (hostname, IP+Host header, port-forward)
- Tests connectivity intelligently (tries hostname first, falls back to IP if needed)

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/minikube_service_url.sh
# or
make minikube-url
```

**Output examples:**

For ClusterIP with Ingress:
```
[INFO] Service type: ClusterIP
[INFO] Ingress hostname: hello-flask.local
Access via: http://hello-flask.local
  or: curl -H "Host: hello-flask.local" http://192.168.49.2
[SUCCESS] App is accessible
```

For NodePort:
```
[INFO] Service type: NodePort
[INFO] Access your app at: http://192.168.49.2:30123
```

**When to run:** When you need to know how to access the deployed service
```bash
bash scripts/minikube_service_url.sh
```

**When to run:** When you need to know how to access the deployed service

---

#### `setup_ingress.sh`
**Purpose:** Set up Ingress controller and configure host resolution.

**What it does:**
- Enables nginx ingress controller in Minikube
- Waits for ingress controller pods to be ready
- Adds `hello-flask.local` entry to `/etc/hosts`
- Verifies setup is complete

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup_ingress.sh
```

**When to run:** Once per Minikube cluster, before deploying with Ingress

**Note:** Requires sudo for `/etc/hosts` modification

## Scripts Architecture

All bash scripts use a **shared utilities library** for consistent output and easier maintenance.

### Shared Library (`scripts/lib/common.sh`)

**Location:** `scripts/lib/common.sh`

**Features:**
- **Color definitions**: `GREEN`, `BLUE`, `YELLOW`, `RED`, `NC` (No Color)
- **Logging functions**: 
  - `log_info()` - Informational messages (blue)
  - `log_success()` - Success messages (green)
  - `log_warning()` - Warning messages (yellow)
  - `log_error()` - Error messages (red)
  - `log_note()` - Important notes (yellow)
- **Header formatting**: `print_header()` - Consistent script headers
- **Debug mode**: `enable_debug_mode()` - Enable verbose trace output (set -x) via DEBUG or VERBOSE env vars
- **Pytest helpers**: 
  - `run_pytest()` - Standardized test execution (improved in Phase 3)
  - `run_pytest_optional()` - Run tests that may not exist (handles exit code 5)
- **Kubernetes helpers**:
  - `kubectl_safe()` - Run kubectl with error context and logging
  - `wait_for_pods_ready()` - Wait for pods to be ready with timeout
- **Performance helpers**:
  - `time_command()` - Execute command with timing information (Phase 3)
- **Validation helpers**: 
  - `command_exists()` - Check if command is available
  - `check_git_repo()` - Verify we're in a git repository
- **Path helpers**: 
  - `get_scripts_dir()` - Get scripts directory path
  - `get_project_root()` - Get project root path

### Advanced Helper Functions

**`run_pytest(test_path, pytest_args, description)` (Phase 3 Improvement)**
- Improved argument handling - no longer uses `eval` for better security
- Properly handles complex pytest marker expressions
- Example:
  ```bash
  run_pytest "test_k8s/" "-v -m 'not manual and not nodeport'"
  run_pytest "app/tests/" "-v" "Testing Flask application"
  ```

**`run_pytest_optional(test_path, pytest_args, description, no_tests_message)`**
- Handles pytest exit code 5 (no tests collected) gracefully
- Useful for running optional or manual tests that may not exist yet
- Improved in Phase 3: Better argument handling without `eval`
- Example:
  ```bash
  run_pytest_optional \
      "test_k8s/" \
      "-v -m manual -k readiness" \
      "Running optional manual tests" \
      "No manual tests found yet (this is okay)"
  ```

**`kubectl_safe(description, kubectl_args...)`**
- Wrapper for kubectl commands with better error messages
- Logs what operation is being performed
- Provides context on failure
- Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl_safe "Applying deployment" apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  kubectl_safe "Waiting for rollout" rollout status deployment/hello-flask
  ```

**`wait_for_pods_ready(label, timeout)`**
- Wait for pods matching a label to be ready
- Default timeout is 60 seconds
- Example:
  ```bash
  wait_for_pods_ready "app=hello-flask" 60
  wait_for_pods_ready "app=hello-flask"  # Uses default 60s
  ```

**`time_command(description, command...)` (Phase 3 New)**
- Execute a command and log execution time
- Useful for performance tracking and identifying slow operations
- Logs success/failure with duration
- Example:
  ```bash
  time_command "Building Docker image" docker build -t myapp:latest .
  time_command "Running tests" make test
  time_command "Deploying to cluster" kubectl apply -f k8s/
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  [INFO] Starting: Building Docker image
  ...command output...
  ✅ Completed in 45s: Building Docker image
  ```

### Benefits

✅ **Single source of truth** - Colors and formatting defined once  
✅ **Consistent output** - All scripts use the same style  
✅ **Easier maintenance** - Update logging in one place, applies everywhere  
✅ **Better error handling** - Standardized error messages and strict error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)  
✅ **Code reuse** - Common patterns extracted into reusable functions  
✅ **Easy debugging** - Enable verbose trace mode with `DEBUG=1` or `VERBOSE=1` environment variable  
✅ **Robust operations** - kubectl_safe() and wait_for_pods_ready() improve reliability  
✅ **Secure argument handling** - Removed `eval` usage for safer command execution (Phase 3)  
✅ **Performance visibility** - time_command() helps identify slow operations (Phase 3)  

### Usage Pattern

All scripts follow this pattern:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source the common library
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/common.sh"

# Print script header
print_header "My Script Title"

# Use logging functions
log_info "Processing started..."

# Check prerequisites
if ! command_exists kubectl; then
    log_error "kubectl is not installed"
    exit 1
fi

# Run pytest with standard helper
run_pytest "test_k8s/" "-v"

# Success message
log_success "All done!"
```

### Example Output

When you run a script, you'll see consistent, color-coded output:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  My Script Title
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ℹ Processing started...
✓ All done!
```

### Debug Mode

All scripts support verbose debugging mode for troubleshooting. When enabled, the shell will print each command before executing it (using `set -x`).

**Enable debug mode:**

```bash
# Using DEBUG environment variable
DEBUG=1 bash scripts/unit_tests.sh

# Using VERBOSE environment variable (alternative)
VERBOSE=1 bash scripts/smoke_test.sh

# Works with any script
DEBUG=1 bash scripts/build_image.sh
```

**Example debug output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Unit Tests
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 Debug mode enabled (set -x)
+ SCRIPT_DIR=/home/user/flask_helloworld_miniproject/scripts
+ PROJECT_ROOT=/home/user/flask_helloworld_miniproject
+ cd /home/user/flask_helloworld_miniproject
+ pytest app/tests/ -v
...
```

**When to use:**
- 🐛 Debugging script failures
- 🔍 Understanding script execution flow
- 🛠️ Troubleshooting environment issues
- 📊 Investigating unexpected behavior

kubectl logs -l app=hello-flask --tail=50

# 7. Run Smoke Tests
make smoke-test

# 8. Manual Service Testing
# Test via Ingress
curl -H "Host: hello-flask.local" http://$(minikube ip)/
curl -H "Host: hello-flask.local" http://$(minikube ip)/health

# Test via NodePort (optional)
kubectl patch service hello-flask -p '{"spec":{"type":"NodePort"}}'
minikube service hello-flask --url
# Use the URL from above to test:
# curl <SERVICE_URL>/
# curl <SERVICE_URL>/health

# Restore to ClusterIP
kubectl patch service hello-flask -p '{"spec":{"type":"ClusterIP"}}'

# 9. Test Liveness/Readiness Probes
kubectl describe deployment hello-flask | grep -A 10 "Liveness\|Readiness"

# 10. Test Pod Restart and Recovery
kubectl delete pod -l app=hello-flask --force --grace-period=0

make smoke-test  # Verify service recovered

# 11. Test Scaling
kubectl scale deployment hello-flask --replicas=3
kubectl get pods -l app=hello-flask -w  # Watch scaling (Ctrl+C when ready)
make smoke-test  # Verify with 3 replicas

# Scale back to 2
kubectl scale deployment hello-flask --replicas=2
kubectl get pods -l app=hello-flask -w  # Watch scale down (Ctrl+C when done)
make smoke-test

# 12. Test ConfigMap and Secret Values
kubectl get configmap hello-flask-config -o yaml
kubectl get secret hello-flask-secret -o yaml
# Verify values in pods:
POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=hello-flask -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD -- printenv | grep -E "ENVIRONMENT|APP_NAME|API_KEY|DB_PASSWORD"

# 13. Test Ingress Routing
# Test correct hostname
curl -H "Host: hello-flask.local" http://$(minikube ip)/
# Test wrong hostname (should get 404)
curl -H "Host: wrong-hostname.local" http://$(minikube ip)/

# 14. Load Balancing Test
for i in {1..10}; do 
  curl -s -H "Host: hello-flask.local" http://$(minikube ip)/ | grep -o "hello-flask-[a-z0-9-]*"
done
# Should see requests distributed across different pods

# 15. Final Comprehensive Test
make test-full

# 16. Cleanup (optional)
make delete
kubectl get all -l app=hello-flask  # Should show no resources
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Debugging

**Problem:** Script behaving unexpectedly or failing with unclear errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Enable debug mode to see detailed execution trace
DEBUG=1 bash scripts/<script-name>.sh

# Example: Debug unit tests
DEBUG=1 bash scripts/unit_tests.sh

# Example: Debug build process
VERBOSE=1 bash scripts/build_image.sh
```

This shows:
- ✅ Every command executed by the script
- ✅ Variable values at each step
- ✅ Exact point of failure
- ✅ Environment and path information

### Script Fails with "command not found"

**Problem:** Script can't find `kubectl`, `minikube`, or other commands

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check prerequisites
kubectl version --client
minikube version
docker --version

# Install missing tools
# See main README.md for installation instructions
```

### Tests Fail - Pods Not Ready

**Problem:** Tests run before pods are ready

**Solution:**
```bash
# Wait for pods manually
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=hello-flask --timeout=60s

# Then run tests
bash scripts/k8s_tests.sh
```

### Port Forwarding Conflicts

**Problem:** Port 8080 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill process using port 8080
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
kubectl port-forward svc/hello-flask 8081:5000
```

### Ingress Not Working

**Problem:** Can't access via `hello-flask.local`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-run ingress setup
bash scripts/setup_ingress.sh

# Verify /etc/hosts entry
grep hello-flask /etc/hosts

# Check ingress controller
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:

1. **Source the common library:**
   ```bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/common.sh"
   ```

2. **Use standard logging functions:**
   - `log_info()` for informational messages
   - `log_success()` for success
   - `log_error()` for errors
   - `log_warning()` for warnings

3. **Add to this README** with:
   - Purpose description
   - What it does
   - Usage example
   - When to run it
   - Special notes

4. **Add Makefile target** (optional but recommended)

5. **Test thoroughly** before committing
