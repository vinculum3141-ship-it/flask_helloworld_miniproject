# This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for an application called "hello-flask".
# It specifies that two replicas (pods) of the app should run, each using the Docker image `hello-flask:latest`.
# The deployment manages pods with the label `app: hello-flask`, exposes port 5000, and includes:
# - A readiness probe that checks the root path ("/") to determine if the app is ready to receive traffic
# - A liveness probe that checks the health endpoint ("/health") to detect crashed/deadlocked containers
# This setup is used to deploy and manage a scalable, self-healing instance of your Flask app in a Kubernetes cluster.
